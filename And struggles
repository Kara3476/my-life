Wondering when I can go outside and actually breath
And go outside to see trees.
My mother works everyday, unlike my father.
She takes care of me and works extra farther.
She never gives up on me she is last hope.
I wonder when my father is gonna turn into my hope.

I can never spend my time how I usually want to.
They make me wash dishes without mother to eat or 
Drink. 

Sometimes I think what I do best
Is to lay down on my bed and rest on my chest.
Who is interested in this type of story?
No one cause they are in a hurry to care less about my
Feelings.

One day ill grow and realize what is happening
And sometimes I'll show what is bothering me.

Never give up on hope or your dreams.
The day will come soon, you will see.
